In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?
  * it() is the alias of test() which is the function required by jest in order to run a test. describe() is a function that allows you to group related tests together and also create a nested hierarchy of test.

What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?
  * When test driven development is implemented from the start of development, it has the potential to minimize bugs that will occur as software is built. I think this is a great approach to development, and while it increases the time it takes to build features or software, I think you get that time back by reducing potential debugging time.


Mention three types of automated tests.
  * Unit tests
	* Integration tests
	* End to end tests
